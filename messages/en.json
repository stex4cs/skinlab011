      { "q": "How long does a facial treatment last?", "a": "The average duration of a facial treatment is 60-90 minutes, depending on the type of treatment. Deep cleansing usually takes about 75 minutes, while hydration treatments take about 60 minutes." },
      { "q": "Does laser hair removal hurt?", "a": "Laser hair removal can cause a mild sensation of discomfort, similar to a rubber band snapping against the skin. Our devices have a built-in cooling system that significantly reduces discomfort." },

      { "q": "How should I prepare for a treatment?", "a": "We recommend coming with clean skin without makeup for facial treatments. For laser hair removal, avoid sun exposure 2 weeks before the treatment." },
      { "q": "What is the cancellation policy?", "a": "Please cancel or reschedule your appointment at least 24 hours in advance. Late cancellations or no-shows may result in a charge of 50% of the treatment price." },
